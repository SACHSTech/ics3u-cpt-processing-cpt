# Program Title (edit this)


This game is a snow shovelling simulator, where you play as Doug Ford to shovel snow, you must last 60 seconds (1 minutes) with every 10 seconds the game difficulty increasing until 40 seconds the point of playing to shovel virtual snow. the gameplay is very simple, you press mouse one to decrease the snow stack and if the snow stacks height meets or supersedes the screen height the game will force close with a loss, pressing “r” will change the colour of snow to red , “p” will make it pink “y” is will make it yellow and “w” will make it white and will also start at white.  the score is simple it will just display you lose failure, . there aren’t any important features in the game that I have not implemented except maybe a start menu but everything that needs to work and even some things that don’t are implemented features. This game operates entirely in a for loop with most of the updating variables being the integer i used in the loop, the difficulty is moderated by the speed variable and that only updates the score is only seconds lasted . thanks and have fun
